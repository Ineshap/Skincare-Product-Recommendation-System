1. Ensure you have followed the installation steps.
2. Run the appropriate Python script to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.


## Data Sources

The dataset used in this project contains customer data including age, gender, skin type, and skin concerns. It is used for training and testing machine learning models to build the recommendation system. The dataset can be found in the directory.

## Models Tested

We have tested the following machine learning models for their effectiveness in recommending British Cosmetics products:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classification
- Decision Tree Classification

We evaluate these models based on their accuracy and suitability for the recommendation task.
